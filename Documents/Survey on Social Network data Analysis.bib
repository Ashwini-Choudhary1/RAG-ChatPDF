	abstract = {Social networks are the most successful Web 2.0 applications, where users share and create over 2.5 quintillion bytes of data daily. This data can be exploited to retrieve many kinds of information which will be used in several applications. In fact, social networks have attracted considerable attention from researchers in different domains. This paper serves as an introduction to social network data analysis. In this work we present the recent and representative works in social network data analysis in an analytical fashion. We also highlight most important applications and used methods in the context of structural data analysis. Then, we list the major tasks and approaches proposed to analyse added-content in social media.},
