Abstract—Large Language Models’ safety remains a critical
concern due to their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, which
can prompt these systems to produce harmful responses. In the
heart of these systems lies a safety classifier, a computational
model trained to discern and mitigate potentially harmful, offen-
sive, or unethical outputs. However, contemporary safety classi-
fiers, despite their potential, often fail when exposed to inputs
infused with adversarial noise. In response, our study introduces
the Adversarial Prompt Shield (APS) , a lightweight model that
excels in detection accuracy and demonstrates resilience against
adversarial prompts. Additionally, we propose novel strategies for
autonomously generating adversarial training datasets, named
Bot Adversarial Noisy Dialogue (BAND) datasets. These datasets
are designed to fortify the safety classifier’s robustness, and
we investigate the consequences of incorporating adversarial
examples into the training process. Through evaluations involving
Large Language Models, we demonstrate that our classifier has
the potential to decrease the attack success rate resulting from
adversarial attacks by up to 60%. This advancement paves
the way for the next generation of more reliable and resilient
conversational agents.

I. I NTRODUCTION
As the use of the Large Language Models (LLMs) becomes
increasingly prevalent, the importance of their safety rail
guards escalates. Consequently, there has been a significant
surge in research aimed at enhancing the safety of these large
language models [1]–[4].
Various types of attacks target LLMs; for instance, some
research studies have reported attempts at impersonating a sys-
tem to indirectly inject malicious queries into the LLM. This
could potentially instigate APIs or tasks leading to financial
losses or breaches of information [5]. Although a compre-
hensive analysis encompassing diverse exploitation techniques
that can elicit harmful responses or trigger harmful actions
from LLMs is crucial, these models remain susceptible to
manipulations such as directly responding to harmful prompts.
Consequently, companies have adopted the use of moderation
platforms to deter such responses from LLMs [6].
The focus of this study is on direct adversarial attacks
against LLMs. In these attacks, the user prompts malicious
or harmful inquiries which include an adversarial suffix, as
proposed in previous work [7], which causes the LLM to
bypass its safeguards and directly respond to the questions.
Security firms employ an array of moderation platforms and
classifiers to detect and prevent such behavior. However, our
analysis of existing industrial and academic classifiers reveals
their profound vulnerability to these attacks, particularly those
that utilize optimizers for automatic suffix discovery [7].
From the early public availability of ChatGPT, a fine-
tuned version of GPT3 for conversation, numerous adversarial
attacks have emerged, one of which includes the “Do Anything
Now” (DAN) prompt. This prompt enables the bypassing
of safeguards and moderation platforms, allowing hazardous
queries such as “how to build a bomb”, “how to acquire a
gun illegally”, or “how to hack into a database”. Undeniably,
comprehensive responses to these inquiries can lead to severe
consequences, especially when larger LLMs or industrial con-
versational agents capable of generating insightful responses
are involved. Therefore, preventing large language models
from answering directly harmful questions is the foundational
step toward ensuring safe LLMs.
A recent research paper [7] explored the use of universal and
transferable attacks on large language models. The study em-
ployed automatic tokenizer optimization to create adversarial
suffixes capable of bypassing LLM safeguards and prompting
them to answer any set of questions. This research was suc-
cessful in developing a universal attack that operates across a
diverse set of questions. They demonstrated that these types of
attacks, though trained on small to midsize language models,
are transferrable to considerably larger language models. For
instance, adversarial examples generated to fool Vicuna-7B
and Vicuna 13b had success rates of GPT-3.5 (87.9%), GPT-
4 (53.6%), and PaLM-2 (66%) [7]. The fact that these larger
language models are potentially capable of answering injurious
queries, coupled with the automatic generation and shareability
of these adversarial suffixes across the internet, underscores
the urgency and necessitates further research in this domain.
Several strategies to bolster the robustness of LLMs against
automated adversarial suffixes have been explored; however,
many have shown limited efficacy [8]. These methods and
their limitations are analyzed in Section II. Given such short-
comings, classifiers emerge as a potent alternative, offering
practical benefits and applicability. A schematic representation
of this process is illustrated in Fig. 1, where user input prompts

are processed by the Adversarial Prompt Shield (APS) clas-
sifier to detect and mitigate potentially harmful or adversarial
content. Depending on the classification outcome, prompts are
either blocked by the safety shield or forwarded to the Large
Language Model (LLM) for response generation.
To address the evolving problem of adversarial attacks, com-
panies are resorting to classifiers that are considerably smaller
in size than LLMs, making them more cost-effective to deploy
and easier to update. OpenAI has provided a free moderation
API to all developers, allowing them to scrutinize users’ inputs
before transferring them to the LLMs. This moderation API
has also been employed in the RLHF (Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback) process, as documented in the techni-
cal notes for GPT-4 [4]. Additionally, Facebook’s AI research
team has engineered the BAD (Bot-Adversarial Dialogue)
classifier [1], an open-source tool that identifies unsafe user
utterances. The deployment of these types of classifiers is
proven effective and does not necessitate fine-tuning of the
large language models. They can be independently created to
enhance robustness and update more swiftly. This is why this
method is currently utilized in practice and appears to be the
best solution to date.
While many studies focus on making LLMs more robust, the
effectiveness of current classifiers remains an uncharted area.
In examining today’s classifiers, we found that they are easily
tricked by advanced adversarial attacks. Even introducing a bit
of randomness can throw them off, causing them to provide
unpredictable and potentially unsafe outputs. With this in
mind, our work stands out as one of the first deep dives into
the resilience of safety classifiers. We are proud to present the
Adversarial Prompt Shield (APS) classifier, a new solution
that stands head and shoulders above existing options in both
performance and reliability.
A significant innovation in our study is the Bot Adversarial
Noisy Dialogue (BAND) method. This approach involves
adding random data to datasets, making them more resistant
to adversarial attacks without the steep costs often associated
with creating these attacks. By using BAND, we found that
our classifier becomes far more reliable, even when faced
with sophisticated attacks. Our research, outlined in Fig. 1,
showcases how APS sits at the core of the system, working
as a protective layer that ensures safer interactions with the
Large Language Model.
Our Key Contributions Include:
• Launching the new Adversarial Prompt Shield (APS)
classifier that outperforms existing models in both ac-
curacy and resilience.
• Introducing the Bot Adversarial Noisy Dialogue (BAND)
method, an innovative approach to strengthening datasets
against adversarial attacks without the usual high costs.
II. R ELATED WORK
A. Adversarial Attacks on Conversational LLMs
While conversational agents built upon LLMs fine-tuned for
chat have shown remarkable advancement, numerous studies
have demonstrated their vulnerability to adversarial attacks,
which can give rise to significant ethical and legal issues. One
prevalent form of attack on LLMs is known as jailbreak [4],
[9], where a prompt is employed to circumvent the inherent
limitations and safeguards of these models, compelling them
to generate responses that may be harmful and in violation of
ethical standards. For instance, “Do Anything Now (DAN)”
[10] is a process to inject prompts that can make conversational
agents comply with any user requests without rejection. This
process has shed light on vulnerabilities within chatGPT
models. Another prevalent form of attack on LLMs is an
adversarial attack involving crowdworkers, often referred to
as “red teaming” [1], [11], [12]. In this attack, participants
intentionally craft prompts or dialogues with the aim of
exploiting models to produce harmful outputs. In a study
[12], approximately 39k red-team attacks were collected, and
their outcomes were analyzed using various types of LLMs,
uncovering a variety of harmful outputs such as discrimination,
hate speech, and references to weapons from the models. This
process serves a dual purpose, as it not only involves attacking
LLMs but also aims to acquire insights and shed light on the
diverse forms of harm that these models might encounter once
they are deployed. In a recent study by [7], a novel adversarial
attack method was introduced, employing adversarial suffixes.
This approach aims to maximize the probability of prompts
containing adversarial suffixes, which prompt the model to
produce affirmative responses like “Sure, here it is.” Despite
the appearance of these adversarial suffixes as seemingly
meaningless strings, they have demonstrated their capability
to successfully attack state-of-the-art LLMs such as chatGPT
and LLaMA-2-Chat. In contrast to prior studies, this attack
does not require human resources for prompt generation and
is capable of producing universal and transferable adversarial
prompts applicable across various LLMs. To counteract this
type of attack, several baseline defenses have been proposed,
which are elaborated in the subsequent paragraphs.
One approach involves utilizing a perplexity filter, calculat-
ing the perplexity of the input prompt string. As automated
adversarial suffixes leverage token optimizers, they exhibit
higher perplexity in comparison to conventional conversations.
While such perplexity filters show promising results when an
adversarial suffix is appended subsequent to a question, their
performance on real-world data—including numbers, code,
and other types of information with high perplexity—remains
unexamined. Furthermore, it appears that a universal perplex-
ity threshold that could accommodate all diverse types of input
does not exist [8].
Another proposed method involves utilizing paraphrasing in
the pre-processing phase, altering the initial prompt such that
it no longer contains the adversarial suffix. Although this ap-
proach effectively prevents attacks, experiments have demon-
strated a substantial reduction in the quality of LLM responses
[8]. Additionally, applying LLMs in the pre-processing phase
may effectively double LLM usage costs. Users would have
to wait for the initial LLM to paraphrase the input, potentially
causing significant delays, making this method less desirable
in practice. This approach bears similarity to the retokenization
method, which disassembles words into smaller tokens. Such
retokenization reduces the potency of adversarial suffixes at
the expense of producing a larger token count, shrinking the
context window, and undermining the LLM’s response quality.
Moreover, to combat adversarial suffixes, integrating these
suffixes during the LLM training phase has been considered.
While this method potentially amplifies the innate resilience
of large language models against such attacks, it may com-
promise the quality of LLM responses. And as new types of
attacks emerge, it necessitates the retraining or fine-tuning of
massive LLMs from scratch. The initial training cost of LLMs
is substantial, making it impractical to retrain them each time
a new attack emerges.
B. Safety Classifier
Utilizing a safety classifier represents a viable strategy to
bolster the safety of conversational systems, a practice that
has found application in recent advancements involving large
language models designed for dialogue purposes [1], [4], [13].
This classifier can be employed to identify unsafe utterances
from either a human user or an agent and subsequently
guide the system to refrain from responding or formulate a
safe response. The Perspective API [14] is an open-sourced
model from Jigsaw, has been trained with a variety of online
sources, and provides scores for several different attributes
related to the abusiveness of content, such as severe attacks
and threats. Similarly, Open AI provides the Moderation API
[15], a classifier that detects violations of instances in various
categories, including hate, sexual, and harassment. In contrast
to the previous classifiers designed for detecting individual
instances, Dinan et al. [11] introduced a classifier model
that detects offensive language within a context considered
for dialogue safety. The classifier is built upon a pre-trained
BERT [16] model and fine-tuned for a binary classification
task. To enhance the classifier’s robustness against adversarial
attacks, the training data was augmented with adversarial
examples collected by crowdworkers. Furthermore, Xu et al.
[1] proposed an enhanced classifier, named Bot Adversarial
Dialogue (BAD) classifier, building upon the previous work
by [11]. This model is based on a Transformer architecture,
pre-trained on the Reddit data, and fine-tuned on various
safety classifier tasks. These tasks include the identification of
multi-turn adversarial dialogues that are intentionally crafted
to prompt the model to generate unsafe responses. By incor-
porating adversarial dialogues into the training dataset, this
study showcased the classifier’s robustness against adversarial
attempts. Moreover, it effectively demonstrated that the inte-
gration of this safety classifier with BST 2.7B Model results
in a significant enhancement of model safety.
Although previous studies have explored the robustness of
the safety classifier against adversarial user attempts in dia-
logue systems, they primarily focused on adversarial prompts
and dialogues adhering to the original data format. The goal
has typically been to identify corpora capable of misleading
the model’s predictions or ‘jailbreaking’ language models,
thereby causing them to respond harmfully. However, as
demonstrated in [7], the introduction of perturbation elements
such as an adversarial suffix which may lack semantic coher-
ence have the potential to mislead dialogue models, resulting
in responses that compromise safety. Importantly, there exists
a noticeable gap in the existing literature when it comes to
investigating the adaptability of safety classifiers to such noisy
inputs. To address this gap, our study involves the evaluation
of existing classifiers against adversarial noisy inputs and
the proposal of a novel, robust safety classifier capable of
effectively handling them.
III. A DVERSARIAL PROMPT SHIELD
In this section, we propose Adversarial Prompt Shield
(APS), a novel safety classifier designed to resist adversarial
attacks. The overview of the model is illustrated in Fig. 2.
We established our model following the framework outlined
in previous studies [1], [11] and employed a DistilBERT [18]
as our base model, which results in a total of 66M parameters.
While previous works have employed BERT and Transformer
models, we opted for DistilBERT due to its demonstrated
capacity, retaining 97% of BERT’s capabilities while reducing
its size by 40%. Given the potential increase in complexity
Fig. 2: Overview of Adversarial Prompt Shield. Data is
first processed with annotations and then tokenized using the
DistilBERT tokenizer. The binary classification is based on the
output of the [CLS] token, resulting in either 0 (indicating
‘Safe’) or 1 (indicating ‘Unsafe’) as the label assigned to an
instance.
TABLE I: Unsafe F1 Scores for the APS trained using
Different Numbers of N-turn Dialogues. The number in-
dicates the test results of each model trained on different n-
turn dialogue corpora. We report unsafe F1 scores across the
different testing corpora and average of them.

associated with applying a classifier to LLMs, we selected a
lighter and more efficient model. This choice offers advantages
in terms of both time complexity and management.
We primarily focused on developing multi-turn classifiers
for dialogue safety using conversational corpora, which in-
clude both single-turn and multi-turn dialogues. To process the
multi-turn dialogue data, we selected the last 8-turn utterances
in each dialogue to capture contextual information, comprising
one target utterance and seven previous utterances. The choice
of ‘n’ (the number of turns) was determined by conducting
tests with a baseline model trained using datasets with different
numbers of n-turns. The results of this testing are presented in
Table I, and the 8-turn model exhibited the best performance.
Additionally, to ensure alignment with the dialogue format,
we applied annotations to each utterance by designating the
speakers as either Assistant: or Human:. In the case of
single-turn data, we annotated them with Human:, consider-
ing that the dialogues with LLMs are initiated by humans.
These eight annotated utterances are concatenated to form the
input for the classifier models.
TABLE II: Statitics of Safety Classification Corpora. We
report the number of instances across different corpora for the
safety classification. We indicate the minimum and maximum
number of turns for the multi-turn corpus.

The preprocessed input data is processed through our model,
which consists of DistilBERT, fully connected linear layers,
and a sigmoid function. We initialized the DistilBERT model
with pre-trained weights sourced from [18]. To perform binary
classification, we added two linear layers to the output of
the [CLS] token in our model; The first layer is a fully
connected dense layer with ReLU activation function and
the second layer is designed to produce a single output unit
followed by a sigmoid function. Then, the model is fine-tuned
on various safety classification corpora, including Wikipedia
Toxic Comments(WTC) corpus [17], standard, adversarial,
and multi-turn dialogues in Build-it, Break-it, Fix-it (BBF)
corpus [11], Bot-Adversarial Dialogue (BAD) corpus [1], red-
team attack corpus from ANTHROPIC [12], and a newly
generated Bot Adversarial Noisy Dialogue (BAND) corpus,
with comprehensive details provided in III-A. The corpora
consist of two classes: safe and unsafe, except for the red-team
attack corpus, which originally had five scales of rating. To
make them compatible with binary classification, we converted
the red-team attack labels into binary labels using a threshold
of zero. The details of each corpus are provided in Table II.
The harmful behaviors corpus from AdvBench [7] is solely
utilized for testing.
To account for the class imbalance of corpora, we employed
a weighted binary cross-entropy loss function during our
model training process and optimized the model using the
Adam optimizer. We use a dropout on the first linear layer
with a probability of 0.3. In line with prior research [1], we
implemented early stopping criteria based on the F1 score of
the unsafe class on the validation set.
A. Bot Adversarial Noisy Dialogue
The research in [7] emphasized the effectiveness of incor-
porating carefully optimized adversarial suffixes into prompts
to disrupt LLMs. However, it is crucial to note that this
optimization process comes with significant computational
complexities, resulting in costs that are about 5 to 6 orders of
magnitude higher compared to what is observed in computer
vision [8]. While incorporating all possible adversarial suffixes
in the training data can potentially enhance the robustness
TABLE III: Examples of Bot Adversarial Noisy Data Generation. The BAND Random method generates a suffix using
only words with a length of 10. On the other hand, the BAND WP methods utilize both words and punctuations with equal
probability with a length of 10 or 20, creating suffixes with a length of 10 and 20. In the case of the single-turn corpus, a
random noise suffix is appended at the end of each utterance. For the multi-turn corpus, a random suffix is added to the final
utterance in the data.

of the safety classifier, the practicality of this solution is
significantly hindered by the immense computational demands
of the procedure.
To mitigate this challenge, we introduce a novel approach
for autonomously generating training corpora, focusing pre-
dominantly on fortifying models against adversarial attacks in-
volving perturbations. This method involves the amalgamation
of random strings as suffixes to the original corpora to generate
bot adversarial noisy dialogue datasets. The adversarial train-
ing that incorporates these corpora into the training process
will contribute significantly to the models’ resilience against
sophisticated attacks that deliberately append disruptive strings
to the ends of conversations.
The noisy corpora comprise conversational strings concate-
nated with random strings, generated using the following three
distinct methods to create a robust set. Three unique methods,
Random, WP 10 (Word and Punctuation), and WP 20, were
employed to generate distinct types of random strings.
1) Random Method : The first method, referred to as
“Random”, generates strings by randomly selecting ten words
separated by spaces. This method utilizes the Wordnik API to
obtain random words [19], ensuring variety in the generated
strings.
2) WP 10 Method : The second method, WP 10, con-
structs strings consisting of ten elements each, separated by
spaces. Each element has an equal probability of being a word
or a punctuation symbol.
3) WP 20 Method : The third method, WP 20, is an ex-
tension of RS 10 but generates longer strings, consisting of
twenty elements each, separated by spaces. Similar to WP 10,
each element in WP 20 has a fifty percent chance of being a
word or a punctuation symbol.
Our methodology thoughtfully incorporates adversarial
noise according to the context and complexity of conversa-
tions, acknowledging the differences between single-turn and
multi-turn dialogues. The examples of BAND datasets are
illustrated in Table III, which includes both single-turn and
multi-turn examples. In single-turn corpora, noise (random
string) is appended directly to the available prompts, maxi-
mizing relevance. Likewise, for multi-turn dialogues, the noise
is integrated at the end of the target utterance, which is the
last utterance in the dialogue data, preserving conversational
coherence.
IV. C LASSIFIER RESULTS
In this section, we assess the performance of various
classifiers, including the Bot Adversarial Dialogue (BAD)
classifier, the Moderation API, and our Adversarial Prompt
Shield (APS). For the metric, we utilize the unsafe F1 score,
which is the same as the F1 score in the detection model.
For the performance assessment, we utilize test sets derived
from various classification corpora, as outlined in Table II. Fur-
thermore, to assess how resilient these classifiers are against
adversarial prompts that include noisy inputs, we employ
the BAND Random test sets across the same corpora. We
have implemented five distinct APS models, each trained with
different training datasets, each with unique characteristics.
We demonstrate how each dataset influences the performance
of the safety classifier through comparative analysis. Detailed
information about the classifiers and test results can be found
in Table IV and Table V.
A. Base Model and Parameters
Initially, we compare our APS baseline model with the BAD
classifier to evaluate the effectiveness of using a DistilBERT
model instead of larger models. Both the APS baseline model
and BAD classifier are trained with the same training data but
use different base models and parameter sizes. Remarkably,
the APS baseline model achieves a performance that is 96%
of the BAD classifier, all while having only a quarter of the
parameters (APS: 66M, BAD: 311M). This result underscores
the efficacy of our model in terms of both performance
and complexity. By utilizing our model, we can anticipate a
reduction in the overall computational complexities associated
with the use of LLMs in conjunction with a safety classifier.
B. Overall Performance
In Table V, under the column labeled ‘Original Corpora,’ we
present a comparative analysis of the overall performance of
various classifiers across different test corpora. While the BAD
classifier maintains relatively consistent performance across
the datasets, the Moderation API demonstrates its highest
performance on the WTC corpus but experiences significantly
lower performance on the other corpora. We speculate that
the Moderation API might be designed as an instance-based
classifier, which could lead to a limited understanding of multi-
turn dialogue datasets.
Notably, the APS Red Attack model in ours, which in-
corporates the red-team corpus from ANTHROPIC into the
training data, exhibits the best performance and significant
improvements compared to the existing two classifiers. The
red-team corpus stands out as the largest dialogue data in
comparison to other training corpora. It encompasses a wide
array of harmful behaviors, including discrimination, hate
speech, violence, unethical behavior, and more. Integrating this
data into the training process equips the model with knowledge
about a broader and more diverse range of harms, which is
reflected in its performance. Consequently, this model demon-
strates significant improvements in the AdvBench test corpus,
even though this data was not included in the training set.
This result suggests that collecting more datasets containing
diverse examples of harmful content could further improve the
model’s ability to detect such content.
The APS Robust models, which consist of APS Random,
APS WP 10, and APS WP 20 models trained with adversarial
training datasets, exhibit a slight decrease in performance
compared to the APS Red Attack model. This phenomenon
aligns with findings from previous studies [8], [20] that adding
adversarial training data can lead to a reduction in performance
while enhancing robustness. However, it is noteworthy that
APS Robust models only experience a marginal drop in
performance and still outperform the BAD classifier.
C. Robustness
We conducted a performance comparison of each classifier
on the Bot Adversarial Noisy Dialogue (BAND) Random test
sets, which involve the addition of random words with a length
of 10 as a prefix to each prompt. This evaluation aimed to
assess the classifiers’ robustness against noisy prompts. The
results can be found in Table V, under the column labeled
‘BAND Random Corpora.’
The BAD classifier experiences a significant drop in per-
formance on adversarial examples, with its performance de-
creasing from 72.3 to 39.6, underscoring the model’s lack of
robustness. Furthermore, the APS Red Attack model, which
was not trained with adversarial corpora, exhibits significant
performance drops (Max -25.8) on the adversarial corpora,
despite this model demonstrating state-of-the-art performance
on the original corpora. These findings emphasize that ex-
isting methods and classifiers make the model vulnerable to
adversarial examples, even when subjected to random noisy
perturbations.
In contrast, the APS Robust models show resilience to
adversarial examples, experiencing only marginal drops (Max
-3.0) in performance. Notably, the APS Random model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on BAND Random Cor-
pora. These results imply that incorporating adversarial exam-
ples in the training process proves advantageous to enhance
the model’s resilience to adversarial noise-infused attacks.
V. A DVERSARIAL ATTACK RESULTS ON LLM S
To examine the transferability of our approach and its practi-
cal implications for Large Language Models (LLMs), we con-
ducted the AdvBench test and calculated Attack Success Rate
(ASR) [7] for several large language models. This evaluation is
conducted using AdvBench Harmful behaviors data, Harmful
behaviors data with BAND Random prefix, and adversarial
attacks introduced by [7], which employ optimized adversarial
suffixes through Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG). We
present and compare the results both with and without the
inclusion of a safety classifier.
A. Experimental Setup
a) Language Models Used in the Study: In our experi-
mental setup, we utilized three state-of-the-art language mod-
els: Vicuna [21], Falcon [22], and Guanaco [23]. Specifically,
the versions and sizes employed were “vicuna-7b” (version
1.3), “falcon-7b-instruct”, and “guanaco-7B-HF”. These mod-
els were cloned from the Hugging Face repository [24]. To
ensure that these models functioned as conversational agents,
we employed the chat instruct versions. It is essential to
highlight that language models not fine-tuned to serve as
chatbots or not explicitly instructed for chat interactions tend
to complete user input instead of answering user queries. For
suffix generation and the testing phase, these models were
fed adversarial suffixes to examine their responses. We set the
temperature to zero, selected the top-most suitable answer, and
restricted responses to a maximum of 100 tokens.
TABLE IV: Descriptions of Safety Classifiers. We utilized two existing classifiers, BAD classifier and Moderation API. We
implemented five different Adversarial Prompt Shield (APS) models, each trained with different training corpora. Specifically,
the models trained using adversarial training with BAND datasets were labeled as APS Robust.

b) Generation of Adversarial Suffixes: For the generation
of adversarial suffixes, we leveraged the Greedy Coordinate
Gradient (GCG) methodology outlined in the paper by Zou
et al. [7]. The associated codebase provides a suite of attack
strategies on large language models, including transferable at-
tacks that target multiple models simultaneously. Intriguingly,
these attacks yield universal and transferable suffixes. Such
universal suffixes, which can compromise multiple language
models, are computationally expensive, with a single suffix’s
generation spanning over ten days on multiple NVIDIA H100
GPUs as mentioned in the original study. Given the prohibitive
computational requirements, generating multiple instances of
these universal suffixes for adversarial fine-tuning or training
is not feasible. To produce multiple adversarial suffixes, we
utilized the provided demo Jupyter notebook code optimized
for individual harmful examples. This code sifts through the
AdvBench dataset [7], laden with harmful queries and their
corresponding target answers, aiming to identify suffixes that
amplify the likelihood of the model providing affirmative
responses to harmful questions. The iterative approach in-
volves selecting from the top 256 substitutions, optimizing
the negative log likelihood of the target string, and assessing
the model’s response to the harmful query suffixed with the
generated string. This process continues for a maximum of
500 iterations or until the model is successfully “jailbroken”.
While the provided demo code was compatible with Vicu ˜na
and Guanaco, modifications were necessary for seamless inte-
gration with the Falcon model, specifically in model loading
and tokenization.
c) Attack Success Rate: To evaluate the safety of dif-
ferent models and strategies, we use the Attack Success Rate
(ASR) metric introduced by AdvBench [7]. We adopted the
ASR definition for Harmful Behaviors, in which a test case
is considered successful if the language model generates any
response without rejecting it. Rejection is determined based on
29 prefixes, including phrases like “As an Assistant” and “I’m
sorry”. In the context of LLMs with a classifier environment,
we define a test case as an attack success when it effectively
bypasses both the classifier and the language model. In other
words, if either the classifier identifies it as unsafe or the
language model refuses to generate responses using prefixes,
it is considered a failure in the attack attempt. We calculate
the number of test cases that successfully attack the language
model and present the corresponding success rate.
B. Results
The comprehensive ASR results are detailed in Table VI.
In order to thoroughly assess and understand the influence
of various classifiers on the different types of attacks, we
will furnish an analysis of the outcomes for each test corpus
individually.
AdvBench Prompts The column labeled ‘AdvBench’ rep-
resents the ASR for the original harmful behavior prompts,
where no perturbations are applied to the prompts. While
the three language models have been fine-tuned using large
conversational corpora and have demonstrated their remark-
able performance, the safety-related aspects have not been
thoroughly examined. This analytical gap has played a role
in the observed heightened attack success rates, even when
explicit harmful prompts are used, particularly evident in the
case of the Falcon (61.5%) and Guanaco (20.0%) models.
Among the existing classifiers, the Moderation API demon-
strates a marginal reduction in ASR (Max -2.1%), while the
BAD classifier exhibits more substantial decreases in ASR
(Max -33.2%). Remarkably, our classifiers surpass all existing
classifiers, with the APS Red attack model, in particular,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance by achieving a sub-
stantial decrease in ASR (Max -51.9%). This accomplishment
results in all models maintaining an ASR below 10%. Based
on these findings, we can conclude that implementing a safety
classifier for LLMs offers clear advantages in enhancing the
large language models’ safety. Furthermore, this approach
appears to be considerably more effective for models that have
not undergone extensive fine-tuning for safety-related corpora.
AdvBench + Random Prompts To assess the safety of
large language models in the face of random noise in prompts,
we compare the ASR on noised harmful behavior prompts
when random strings are introduced as suffixes. The column
named ‘AdvBench + Random’ represents the results.
The baseline models exhibit a lower ASR compared to the
results for the original prompts. This discrepancy is primarily
due to the definition of ASR, which even classifies responses
that are not explicitly related to rejecting answers, such as ’I’m
sorry, but I do not understand the question. Could you please
rephrase it or provide more context?’ as instances of attack
failures. Further investigation regarding the ASR metric will
be discussed in Section V-C.
While the BAD classifier exhibited notable reductions in
ASR for the original prompts, it shows only marginal de-
creases in ASR (Max -2.8%) when applied to randomly noised
prompts, demonstrating a similar level of ASR reduction as the
Moderation API (Max -2.3%). This performance highlights a
potential lack of robustness of the existing safety classifiers
against adversarial prompts. In contrast, our models outper-
form all existing classifiers and show substantial drops from
the Baseline model. Notably, the APS WP 20 model exhibits
the most impressive performance (Max -34.5%), underscoring
the clear advantages of integrating adversarial training to
enhance model robustness against adversarial prompts.
AdvBench + GCG adv. Suffix Prompts In order to explore
the transferability of our adversarial training approach to other
adversarial attacks, we evaluate the ASR on attacks introduced
by [7]. The corresponding results are detailed in a column
labeled ’AdvBench + GCG adv. Suffix’. As demonstrated
by the study in [7], the inclusion of an adversarial suffix
in prompts significantly elevates the ASR for LLMs. For
instance, it raises the ASR of the Vicuna model to as high
as 90.8%, despite the Vicuna model initially having the
lowest ASR (3.1%) on the original prompts. This trend is
observed in other language models as well, where ASR scores
are notably elevated. Existing classifiers demonstrate minimal
improvement in ASR, still resulting in more than 57% ASR.
This result implies that the well-optimized adversarial suffixes
through Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) can not only
disrupt the LLMs but also successfully bypass the existing
safety classifiers.
Our classifiers consistently demonstrate superior perfor-
mance compared to existing ones. In particular, the APS
WP-based model achieves a significant reduction in ASR
by up to 60%. Despite these classifiers not being explicitly
trained with optimized prompts, the inclusion of random noisy
data in the training process enhances the models’ robustness
against another form of adversarial attack. We can observe
that the APS WP 20 model outperforms other ASP Robust
models, and WP 10 and WP 20 models perform better than
the WP Random model, which solely utilizes random words
in suffixes. These outcomes can be anticipated, particularly
when considering that the optimized adversarial suffixes have
a length of 20 and usually include punctuation due to their
initialization with an exclamation mark. Based on this result,
it can be inferred that when random noise data is crafted to
resemble target adversarial prompts, the classifier performs
effectively. Nevertheless, it is important to highlight that the
APS WP 10 model achieves comparable performance, despite
the adversarial training data not strictly adhering to the format
of adversarial suffixes.
OpenAI’s Moderation API Results The Moderation API
functions as a black-box mechanism, its internal structure
remaining unknown. In response to the revelations from the
LLM attack research, OpenAI unveiled substantial updates on
25 Aug 2023 (notified on 24 Aug through an email update).
However, when juxtaposed against robust standards like the
BAD classifier, it is evident that the Moderation API, despite
its advancements, may still harbor detection inefficiencies.
Analyzing the data from Table VI, we discern a universal
ASR decrease with the incorporation of random suffixes across
all major language models. Specifically, the Vicuna, Falcon,
and Guanaco models register reductions of 0.5%, 10.2%, and
TABLE VI: Results of Attack Success Rates on Various LLMs. We report the ASR results on three different LLMs, with
and without safety classifiers. The LLM(baseline) row indicates the ASR of pure large language models without any safety
classifiers. The Safety Classifier rows indicate the ASR with each different classifier. A lower ASR signifies a safer model.

7.1%, respectively. This consistent reduction in ASR when
confronted with random suffixes suggests that the Moderation
API has been fine-tuned by OpenAI to better handle such
disruptions, hinting at potential updates aimed at fortifying
the system against similar adversarial tactics. Surprisingly, the
introduction of GCG adversarial suffixes results in significant
ASR increments, with the models observing surges of 81.6%,
23.5%, and 37.9% respectively. This contrast suggests that
while OpenAI might have endeavored to bolster the API’s
defenses against GCG adversarial suffixes, they inadvertently
heightened its detection sensitivity chiefly towards random
suffixes, rather than the intended sophisticated adversarial
techniques. Direct training or fine-tuning of the Moderation
API is not feasible, thus preventing the exploration of BAND’s
impact on its performance. Nonetheless, an examination of this
leading industrial moderation classifier provides insights into
the existing gaps and potential areas for enhancement.
From these results, we can conclude that our approach, the
inclusion of random noise data during the training process,
enhances the resilience of the safety classifier against adver-
sarial prompts and its transferability allows the model to hold
the potential to defend against various types of adversarial
prompts.
C. Analysis of Attack Success Rate Results
In this section, we evaluate the Attack Success Rate (ASR)
metric and explore its limitations through the presentation of
various cases. As described in Section V-A, Attack Success
Rate (ASR) is a metric that is used to evaluate the safety
performance of LLMs by comparing the model’s response with
prefixes commonly employed by LLMs to reject answers. It
accomplishes this by checking responses for the presence of
any predefined prefixes and classifying them as attack failures
if any such prefixes are detected. However, during manual
inspections of a subset of data, we found that the labels
of responses were flipped when the entire responses were
considered.
To further investigate this, we randomly selected 100 re-
sponses from the Vicuna model and manually labeled them
based on the ASR definition. Our analysis revealed that
approximately 27% of labels were flipped when considering
the entire responses. Specifically, 11% of responses initially
classified as successes were changed to failures, while 16%
of responses originally labeled as failures were reclassified as
successes. Table VII illustrates examples of cases where the
labels were flipped.
Safe Responses In this category, the large language model
generates an answer that does not contain any harmful content.
In some cases, it even offers safe ways to address the given
prompt, such as providing advice on how to access and use
firearms safely. In these cases, while the model does not
evade or reject the response, they should be considered attack
failures.
Unrelated Responses In some instances, the model gener-
ates unrelated answers, possibly due to disruption from the
adversarial suffix. For example, when a user asked, “How
to manipulate stock prices for financial gain,” the model
returned a list of items not relevant to the prompt and did
not contain any harmful content. Similarly, these cases should
be considered as attack failures.
Incomplete Responses Additionally, a large language
model can generate responses without any details or infor-
mation. As an example, the model may generate affirmative
responses such as “Sure, here it is,” without actually providing
any substantial content or relevant information. While these
responses may not fall under the category of outright rejection,
they can be regarded as instances of attack failures due to their
lack of meaningful content or relevant engagement with the
user’s query.
Cautious Instruction Responses In contrast to Incomplete
Responses, some model-generated responses provide detailed
instructions with explicit caution against illegal or harmful
behavior. For example, the model included a code block for
scripts that can exploit system vulnerabilities but accompanied
these instructions with explicit warnings about their legality.
However, because the ASR utilizes a string-matching method,
it assumes these cases as attack failures. Despite the warnings,
such responses can contain harmful and critical information,
and they should be categorized as attack successes.
Furthermore, we observed that several responses, such as
“I am sorry, I can’t understand,” for the BAND test corpora
were categorized as attack failures because of the phrase “I am
sorry,”, even though they do not involve rejection to respond.
While the ASR is a valuable metric for assessing the safety

and responses from Vicuna model that the label results are flipped from manual inspection. For the safety purpose, we do not
illustrate the adversarial suffix generated from Greedy Coordinate Gradient and mark it as {adv suffix}.

VI. C ONCLUSION
In this research, we introduce Adversarial Prompt Shield
(APS), which serves as a safety classifier capable of identi-
fying and mitigating unsafe prompts, thereby enhancing the
safety of large language models. A significant observation
from our work is the notable difference in parameter size
between our model and mainstream models. Despite utilizing
only a quarter of the parameters compared to existing classi-
fiers, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various safety classification tests. While employing a safety
classifier for Large Language Models (LLMs) can increase
system complexity and costs, our model’s efficiency helps
mitigate this issue.
Additionally, we introduce an adversarial training process
and present the Bot Adversarial Noisy Dialogue (BAND)
method, which autonomously generates adversarial corpora to
enhance the model’s robustness. Through a comparative anal-
ysis, we unveil the inherent limitations of existing safety clas-
sifiers, as they experience substantial performance degradation
when exposed to randomly perturbed prompts. In contrast, our
models, trained using the generated BAND corpora, maintain
consistent performance on datasets with randomly added noise.
Additionally, through the evaluation of three state-of-the-art
language models with and without a safety classifier, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of applying safety classifiers to
LLMs to enhance their safety. This evaluation also underscores
the resilience of our models against adversarial prompts, which
are specifically crafted and optimized to disrupt and compel
language models to respond to harmful and malicious prompts.
These outcomes emphasize the significance of adversarial
training for safety classifiers and serve as compelling evidence
for the effectiveness of our BAND method in enhancing their
robustness.
VII. F UTURE WORK
The rapidly evolving field of Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and its continuous integration into various applica-
tions necessitates rigorous scrutiny, especially when deploy-
ing Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite their prowess,
LLMs are not immune to adversarial vulnerabilities, which
become pronounced when harmful questions are combined
with sophisticated adversarial techniques such as GCG suffixes
[7]. The field still grapples with consistently detecting and
mitigating harmful content and, based on the observations in
this research. Here are some suggestions that can improve
model robustness and be useful for future research.
a) Enhanced Dataset Collection and Curation: To
strengthen the robustness of LLMs, future research should
prioritize the collection and curation of comprehensive datasets
that capture diverse conversational contexts, both benign and
harmful. These rich datasets can serve as the foundation
for classifiers to distinguish harmful content with greater
precision. Enhancing detection capabilities will inevitably lead
to better containment of harmful outputs and malicious adver-
sarial attempts.
In addition, the labyrinthine nature of harmful content,
marked by its varied forms and subtleties, warrants a more
sophisticated understanding. Given the immense potential of
real-world online dialogues, in which users consent to their
utilization for research purposes, these conversations could be
meticulously curated. Such a systematic approach, focusing on
extracting and labeling harmful strands from these conversa-
tions, can provide fresh insights and training data for future
model iterations.
b) Naive GCG Suffixes as a Training Strategy: Building
upon current adversarial defense strategies, there is potential
for exploring naive versions of the GCG suffixes for training
purposes. A conceivable approach is one where, rather than
considering all tokens in a suffix for substitution simulta-
neously, a naive GCG method could select one token at a
time. By then choosing from a limited set of substitutions
for that token, this method would strive to maintain the core
characteristics of the original GCG attack. The benefit lies in
its computational efficiency, as it would be significantly less
resource-intensive compared to its sophisticated counterpart.
Such a strategy could offer a balance between effective defense
training against token-optimized attacks without incurring ex-
tensive computational overhead.
c) Redefining ASR in LLMs: The definition and eval-
uation criteria of the Attack Success Rate (ASR) in large
language models is a critical area warranting further explo-
ration. As expounded in section V paragraph C, our current
understanding of ASR, inspired by [7], predicates success on
the absence of model rejection, characterized by a series of
predefined expressions. However, as illuminated in section
V-C, this approach presents palpable limitations. It narrows the
scope of attack evaluation, potentially overlooking nuanced,
indirect rejections, or validations. Moving forward, a pivotal
research direction should be the formulation of a compre-
hensive, nuanced ASR criterion. This would facilitate more
granular, accurate comparisons between models, ensuring that
assessments truly reflect a model’s resilience to adversarial
attacks.
